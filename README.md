## Data Cleaning
All categorical features are in long format therefore by using power query editor in Microsoft Excel, we have made it short without changing its meaning for better visualization and data labelling.

## Data visualization techniques
After data cleaning, a set of research questions were formed to obtain the insights from the data considering the aim of the project.  

We worked on this data using Microsoft Excel out of the provided data visualization tools. For analyzing the data Pivot Tables were utilized extensively and graph were used from Pivot chart.
